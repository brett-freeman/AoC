# AoC
Advent of Code Solutions

After a few years of not coding, here I am learning it again. No googling for solutions specifically, only to figure out how to do a certain thing in Python. Utilized ChatGPT for re patterns.
Main reflects 2023 Advent of Code because this is the first year I have attempted it.
